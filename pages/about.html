    <h1>Paragraph about me</h1>
    <p>I was born in Vancouver, Canada and lived here for 9 years. I then moved to South Africa and lived there for 9
        and a half years.
        I returned back to Vancouver in 2019. I enjoy learning and gaining experience about technology and computers
        <em>that is why i am
            taking CIT at BCIT</em>. During my free time, I <strong>really enjoy</strong> hiking, watching tv and
        sleeping.
